            </span>
            <div class=" paragraph">"Effective at helping the business leaders achieve desired outcomes" Successful organizational design and development outcomes require intricate internal navigation and a fine balance of using multiple of approaches ranging from the large scale structured interventions to intense personal conversations. The uniqueness of ODA is that they have managed to achieve this through their engagement with IDFC in last one year! They straddle this full range and that, makes them not only more efficient (one doesn't need to go to multiple organizations) but incredibly more effective at helping the business leaders achieve desired outcomes. I have worked with Santhosh at length and his ability to synthesize the different strands, spot patterns and "suggest, way forward is truly syncretic and often magical!</div>

          <div class=" paragraph">"Simplicity of delivery, insightful anecdotes and expertise in human behaviour..." Refreshing Mission Vision and Values for an organization can be a fairly energizing and unifying experience, if handled deftly. This is exactly how it turned out for us when Santhosh Babu facilitated this initiative with our top leadership team. Santhosh has this unique style of connecting with the audience by understanding the organization environment, and key business drivers. His simplicity of delivery, insightful anecdotes and expertise in human behaviour make him a good choice to facilitate large scale critical people intervention. He has demonstrated this skill several times. Besides helping Max Life team refresh its Vision Mission Values, he has also effectively facilitated multiple Max Group level Leadership meets. Santhosh has been a great partner and we wish him and OD Alternatives all the best!</div>

Facilitating our strategy meet, help our teams manage change, support our leaders through change and building team effectiveness are some of the areas we worked with ODA team. What strikes me is their ability to understand complex organisational contexts along with individual contexts of leaders and design interventions that are innovative, impactful and transformational. There is a personal touch, customized approach and conceptual rigor in what ever they do. Driving change and Transformational leadership is something in the core DNA of ODA.</div>
